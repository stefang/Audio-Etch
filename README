Audio Etch

Originally devised to create a stereo visualisation of an audio track to etch on the flip side of a single sided 12" single. The band didn't go with the idea so it's free to release.

It outputs a PDF document that will need cleaning up before it's ready to use for etching. You'll need to remove the white background block and then select all and use the "Unite" Pathfinder tool to join the slivers into solid vector shapes.
